Hello, my name is Youngeun Yoon, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Kyung Hee University. I am particularly interested in advancing my studies and am preparing to apply for a Master's program.

Throughout my academic journey and hands-on experience, I have developed expertise in sensor design, signal processing, and algorithm development. With 1.5 years of internship experience in the Radiology Department at Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital, I have gained valuable clinical insights and a profound interest in data visualization and human-computer interaction.

Please do not hesitate to contact me via email regarding any opportunities you would like to discuss.
